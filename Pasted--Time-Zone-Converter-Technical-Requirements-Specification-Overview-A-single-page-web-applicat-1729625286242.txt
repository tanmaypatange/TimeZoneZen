## Technical Stack Recommendations
- Frontend: React/Vue.js for dynamic updates
- Time Zone Library: Moment.js with timezone data or Luxon
- City Database: JSON file with regular updates
- Styling: CSS framework of choice (Bootstrap/Tailwind)

## Notes for Implementation
- Ensure all time calculations happen in UTC to avoid errors
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Consider adding a "Copy to Clipboard" feature for converted times
- Include loading states for dropdowns and conversions
- Consider adding URL parameters for sharing specific conversions
